        <h2><u>JavaScript</u>:</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interperted, or on-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.It is commonly used for creating interactive web pages and applications.Some basic details about JavaScript for beginner include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>1.Syntax: JavaScript syntax is similar to other programming languages such as C++ or Java. Statements are written in a sequence and are enclosed in curly braces { }. Semicolons ; are used to separate statements.</li>
            <li>2.Variables: Variables in JavaScript are used to store values such as numbers or text. They are declared using the var, let, or const keywords.</li>
            <li>3.Functions: Functions are used to group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. They can be called at any point in the code.</li>
            <li>4.Objects: Objects are collections of properties and methods. Properties are the characteristics of an object, while methods are the functions that can be performed on an object.</li>
            <li>5.DOM: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a way of representing HTML and XML documents as objects that can be manipulated with JavaScript. This allows for dynamic content and interaction with web pages.</li>
            <li>6.Events: JavaScript can respond to events such as mouse clicks, key presses, and page loads. These events can trigger functions to perform specific actions.</li>
            <li>7.Libraries and Frameworks: There are many libraries and frameworks available in JavaScript to help with common tasks and make coding easier. Examples include jQuery, React, and Angular.</li>
            <li>8.Debugging: Debugging is an important part of coding in JavaScript. Browsers have built-in tools such as the console for viewing errors and debugging code.</li>
            <li>9.ES6: ECMAScript 6 (ES6) is the latest version of JavaScript and introduces many new features such as arrow functions, template literals, and classes. It is important for beginners to be familiar with these new features as they become more
                widely used in modern JavaScript development.</li>
        </ol>
